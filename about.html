    <h1>About Dr. Alexia M. Hernández</h1>

    <p>
      Dr. Alexia M. Hernández is a linguistic consultant specializing in AI applications, with 
      expertise in speech variation, accents, and human–machine communication. Her work focuses on 
      helping organizations develop AI systems that understand the diversity of human voice and text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alexia holds an MBA from the Wharton School and a PhD in Linguistics from Stanford University, 
      where she researched how people produce and perceive speech variation and accents—work that 
      integrates sociolinguistics, cognitive science, and experimental methods. She graduated 
      <em>summa cum laude</em> and Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton University with a BA in Linguistics, 
      earning top departmental prizes for her research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her research has been presented at leading conferences such as the Linguistic Society of America, 
      Psychonomics, and New Ways of Analyzing Variation, and published in respected venues including 
      the <em>Journal of Cognitive Science</em>. Her work advances understanding of how listeners make 
      rapid inferences based on voice alone, and how these perceptual processes shape real-world 
      communication and technology design.
    </p>

    <p>
      At LexAI Consulting, Alexia brings this expertise into applied settings—collaborating with 
      product, research, and strategy teams to evaluate AI-generated language, analyze speech data, 
      improve voice interfaces, and design evaluation frameworks that reflect real human communication. 
      Her work bridges rigorous linguistic research with practical, user-centered recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      With experience across academia, tech, AI strategy, and language-focused research roles, Alexia 
      offers a rare combination of analytic rigor, linguistic depth, and product-aligned thinking. She 
      works with organizations seeking clarity in complex language questions, better human–AI interaction, 
      and linguistically informed system design.
